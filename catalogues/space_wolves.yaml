    description: 'Each time an attack targets this unit, if it contains models with
      different Toughness characteristics, until the attacking unit has finished making
      its attacks, use the Toughness characteristic of the majority of the models
      in that unit when determining what roll is required for that attack to successfully
      wound. If two or more Toughness characteristics are tied for majority, use the
      highest value. 

      For the purposes of determining which models in this unit can embark within
      a TRANSPORT, Kill Team Terminator models, Kill Team Outrider models, Kill Team
      Biker models and models equipped with a jump pack each take up the space of
      2 models, but can otherwise embark within any TRANSPORT their unit can embark
      within, even though similar models in other units have the TERMINATOR, MOUNTED
      or JUMP PACK keywords. 

      For the purposes of interacting with terrain features, all models in units with
      this ability are considered Infantry models, even though similar models in other
      units may have the Mounted or Jump Pack keywords. 

      **Designer’s Note**: *While the abstractions in the above rule cause some models
      to behave differently to similar models in other units, they are designed to
      minimise complicated movement, Transport and Benefit of Cover rules.*'

    description: 'Each time an attack targets this unit, if it contains models with
      different Toughness characteristics, until the attacking unit has finished making
      its attacks, use the Toughness characteristic of the majority of the models
      in that unit when determining what roll is required for that attack to successfully
      wound. If two or more Toughness characteristics are tied for majority, use the
      highest value. 

      For the purposes of determining which models in this unit can embark within
      a TRANSPORT, Kill Team Terminator models, Kill Team Outrider models, Kill Team
      Biker models and models equipped with a jump pack each take up the space of
      2 models, but can otherwise embark within any TRANSPORT their unit can embark
      within, even though similar models in other units have the TERMINATOR, MOUNTED
      or JUMP PACK keywords. 

      For the purposes of interacting with terrain features, all models in units with
      this ability are considered Infantry models, even though similar models in other
      units may have the Mounted or Jump Pack keywords. 

      **Designer’s Note**: *While the abstractions in the above rule cause some models
      to behave differently to similar models in other units, they are designed to
      minimise complicated movement, Transport and Benefit of Cover rules.*'

    description: 'Each time an attack targets this unit, if it contains models with
      different Toughness characteristics, until the attacking unit has finished making
      its attacks, use the Toughness characteristic of the majority of the models
      in that unit when determining what roll is required for that attack to successfully
      wound. If two or more Toughness characteristics are tied for majority, use the
      highest value. 

      For the purposes of determining which models in this unit can embark within
      a TRANSPORT, Kill Team Terminator models, Kill Team Outrider models, Kill Team
      Biker models and models equipped with a jump pack each take up the space of
      2 models, but can otherwise embark within any TRANSPORT their unit can embark
      within, even though similar models in other units have the TERMINATOR, MOUNTED
      or JUMP PACK keywords. 

      For the purposes of interacting with terrain features, all models in units with
      this ability are considered Infantry models, even though similar models in other
      units may have the Mounted or Jump Pack keywords. 

      **Designer’s Note**: *While the abstractions in the above rule cause some models
      to behave differently to similar models in other units, they are designed to
      minimise complicated movement, Transport and Benefit of Cover rules.*'
